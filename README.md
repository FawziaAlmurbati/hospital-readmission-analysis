# Hospital Readmission Analysis
This project analyzes hospital readmission patterns among diabetic patients using the UCI Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset.

## Key Insights:

- Comorbidities (e.g., heart failure) increase risk
- Low number of procedures/lab tests linked to readmission

## Tools:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
